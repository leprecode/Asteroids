# Flat Asteroids

## About

It is an Unity 2D-Game for Windows. 

**Status of project:** Finished!

### The main goal of the project

I did this project as a test task when applying for a job in one of the game studios. 
The task was to make a working clone of the famous Asteroids for Windows. 
During development, it was forbidden to use third-party frameworks and plugins. 
The inertia for the player's ship also needed to be written without using the Unity's built-in physics engine. 
The project was done in a modern flat design.

This project is complete but has a few non-critical bugs. 
The project code has several disadvantages, the main ones: 
- a large number of classes (53)
- non-single and non-expandable object pool
- a lot of hardcoded tags
- unnecessary containers in the scene for object pools
- there are search operations in the code
- wrong use of the singleton pattern

This test task seemed to me one of the most interesting for me. I made many mistakes and learned how to not make them again.
